Designing a One-Shot Code Editing Agent for Sequential Issue Resolution

`gitscaffold` provides a powerful integration with the `aider` AI coding assistant to automate the resolution of GitHub issues. The `process-issues` command allows you to process a list of issues in a disciplined, one-shot manner.



# Aider One-Shot Issue Processing

`gitscaffold` provides a powerful integration with the `aider` AI coding assistant to automate the resolution of GitHub issues. The `process-issues` command allows you to process a list of issues in a disciplined, one-shot manner.

## How it Works

The command reads a text file where each line represents a task or an issue to be addressed. It then iterates through each line and invokes `aider` in a separate, non-interactive "one-shot" session for each task.

This approach is useful for:

-   **Batch Processing:** Applying a set of refactorings or fixes across your codebase.
-   **Atomic Changes:** Ensuring each issue is addressed in a separate, auto-committed change, making for a clean and reviewable git history.
-   **Unattended Execution:** Running a series of coding tasks without manual intervention for each one.

## Usage

1.  **Create an issues file:**
    Create a text file (e.g., `tasks.txt`) with one issue description per line:

    ```text
    tasks.txt
    -----------
    Refactor the User model to use composition instead of inheritance.
    Add unit tests for the authentication service.
    Update dependencies and resolve any vulnerabilities.
    ```

2.  **Run the command:**
    Invoke `gitscaffold` to process the file:

    ```bash
    gitscaffold process-issues tasks.txt
    ```

    `gitscaffold` will then call `aider` for each line in `tasks.txt`. Aider will attempt to complete the task and commit the changes if successful.

### Command Options

-   `--results-dir <directory>`: Specify a directory to save logs for each Aider run. Defaults to `results/`.
-   `--timeout <seconds>`: Set a timeout for each individual Aider process. Defaults to 300 seconds.

This disciplined, one-shot approach to issue processing with Aider enables a new level of automation in your development workflow.


The Problem with Multi-Agent Complexity

Using multiple coding agents concurrently or tackling many issues in one go can lead to chaotic outcomes. Users have likened letting several AI agents roam a codebase to “automatic lawnmowers” ruining the garden – things quickly go off the rails without oversight ￼. Edits can conflict, context gets muddled, and it becomes hard for a human to follow the changes. This rising complexity is exactly what you’ve observed when attempting to blitz multiple issues at once. The result is often lost productivity and confusion, as the agents may introduce new problems or step on each other’s changes.

Why One-at-a-Time? The antidote to this chaos is to slow down and handle one issue at a time, ensuring each change is isolated and understood. This approach is essentially applying the principle of atomic commits to AI-driven code edits – make each change a focused, self-contained unit. Not only does this reduce conflicts, but it also aligns with best practices in software engineering. In fact, an atomic commit (one that “does exactly one thing — and nothing more”) is easier to review, test, and revert ￼. When working with AI, such small, incremental steps dramatically reduce context drift and hallucinations, keeping the AI’s behavior more reliable ￼. By breaking your work into focused tasks and reviewing each step (just as you would with atomic commits), you maintain control over the development process even with an AI assistant involved ￼.

The One-Shot Sequential Approach (Atomic Issue Resolution)

Your idea is to dispatch a coding agent in a one-shot manner for each issue on a list, sequentially. This means the agent will address a single task, apply the code changes, document them (e.g. via commit message), and then exit before moving on to the next task. This approach has several benefits:
	•	Isolation of Changes: Each issue is handled independently. If one fix doesn’t fully work or introduces a bug, it’s confined to its own commit/branch and won’t automatically taint fixes for other issues. There’s no intertwined “nested path” of edits – you avoid the scenario where fixing issue A inadvertently breaks the work done for issue B, since A and B are addressed in separate runs.
	•	Clarity and Traceability: Because the agent exits after each task, you (the human developer) can inspect exactly what was done for that issue. The results are “well-documented” – typically in the form of a commit diff and message. Many AI coding tools automatically generate sensible commit messages describing the changes ￼. This commit log becomes a chronological story of how each problem was solved. It’s much easier to navigate and understand a series of small commits than a giant monolithic change. It also enables using standard Git tools to review or undo any single change if needed (undoing an AI-generated commit is straightforward with Git ￼ ￼).
	•	Reduced Cognitive Load: As you noted, swarming a problem with multiple agents or tackling a whole list of issues in one big session can cause you to “lose as much as you gain” in terms of understanding. In contrast, a step-by-step approach lets you regain control. You can verify each change, run tests, and ensure you understand it before proceeding. This aligns with the notion that smaller changes are easier to mentally process and less likely to introduce bugs ￼.
	•	Minimized Interference: If an issue remains partially fixed or unresolved, it won’t derail the others. You can decide to re-run the agent on that same issue (perhaps with an adjusted prompt) or fix it manually, but since other issues were not tackled in the same run, they remain unaffected. This compartmentalization is a form of risk mitigation.

In summary, the one-shot sequential method makes a lot of sense – it’s essentially bringing agile, incremental development principles to AI-assisted coding. It mirrors how experienced developers often work: break down the work into small commits and address them one by one, which has been shown to improve quality and ease of debugging ￼ ￼.

Choosing a Coding Agent Framework

Now, how to implement this? You have a few options when it comes to coding agents:
	•	Aider (AI Pair Programmer CLI): Given that Aider is your favorite open-source CLI coding agent, it’s a prime candidate. Aider is designed to work with a local Git repository and can edit code across multiple files, then commit the changes automatically ￼. Some key advantages of Aider for this use-case:
	•	Git Integration: Aider will commit each set of changes with a message. This is perfect for our needs, since we want a commit log of each issue fix. The commit messages are often descriptive (sometimes even including parts of the prompt or diff for clarity) ￼ ￼. You can later refine the commit message if needed, but having the agent do it saves time.
	•	Multi-Language Support: You mentioned Python and Rust – Aider supports 100+ programming languages and is not limited to a specific tech stack ￼. Whether your project is in Python, Rust, or includes multiple languages, Aider can handle it.
	•	Focused Diffs: Aider tries to work with unified diffs rather than regenerating whole files ￼. It only sends the changes to the model, which makes the AI’s job easier and reduces cost. It also constructs a “repo map” of your codebase ￼, meaning it keeps track of file names and basic content, so it can intelligently decide which files to open or modify for a given task. This is invaluable for one-shot agents because if your issue is, say, “fix the null pointer exception in FooService,” Aider can locate FooService.java (or .py, .rs, etc.) and load the relevant parts into context automatically.
	•	Agentic vs. One-Shot: By design, Aider can perform multi-step reasoning if you give it a complex, open-ended task (it will plan and possibly modify multiple files in one session) ￼. However, you don’t have to use it that way. You can treat Aider in a simpler one-issue-per-run fashion. For example, in practice you might invoke Aider with a specific prompt like “/fix Issue: Ensure the connect() function closes the connection on error” and Aider will make that change and commit it, then you terminate the session. In essence, you’d be using Aider more like a targeted patch generator rather than an ongoing chat. This flexibility is great – you can still tap into Aider’s multi-step ability when needed (for bigger refactors), but for most issues you keep it atomic.
	•	Automation-Friendly: Although Aider is typically an interactive CLI (it drops you into a chat with the AI agent), it can be automated. In fact, a GitHub Actions workflow has demonstrated exactly this: automatically turning GitHub issues into PRs using Aider. In that setup, whenever an issue is labeled “aider”, a workflow spins up Aider in a container to address that single issue. It runs one prompt, commits the changes to a new branch, and opens a PR for review ￼ ￼. This is proof that Aider can function in a one-shot, fire-and-exit mode. You could emulate a similar approach locally: for each issue, run Aider with the issue description (or a short prompt summarizing the fix) and let it commit changes. Each run would correspond to one issue/branch. (Under the hood, the GH Action uses Aider’s CLI non-interactively, likely by passing the prompt via command-line or a here-document. You might use a similar technique with a script calling aider and feeding it the prompt.)
	•	Linting & Testing Hooks: Aider has an option to automatically run linters and tests after it makes changes ￼. If a test fails, Aider can even attempt to fix the code it just wrote. This could be very useful for ensuring each one-shot fix doesn’t break the build. For instance, if you integrate your test suite, the agent would know immediately if its fix for issue X caused a regression and could try to correct it before finalizing the commit. This feature is worth exploring if you plan to automate the sequence fully, as it provides an extra safety net on each iteration. (It’s optional, so you can decide how much autonomy to give the agent in fixing test issues.)
Given these capabilities, extending or customizing Aider for your needs is quite feasible. You might not even need to modify Aider’s source; it could be as simple as writing a wrapper script. For example, you could write a Python script that reads a list of issues (perhaps from a file or just a Python list) and for each issue: invokes Aider with the appropriate prompt, waits for it to finish (and commit), then moves to the next. The heavy lifting (AI prompting, diff generation, applying edits, committing) is all done by Aider – your script is just orchestrating the sequence. This approach leverages a well-maintained project (Aider has a vibrant community and is under active development ￼ ￼) instead of reinventing the wheel. It also means you can easily get updates/improvements from Aider (e.g. better diff handling or support for new models) by just updating that dependency.
	•	Continue.dev (CLI & IDE extension): Continue is another open-source tool that is often mentioned alongside Aider. It provides IDE extensions and a CLI for custom code agents ￼. The philosophy of Continue is a bit different: it’s more of a one-shot or single-step assistant, responding to direct prompts and acting like a super-powered autocomplete or Q&A engine for your code, rather than an autonomous multi-step agent ￼. For instance, you highlight a piece of code and ask a question or give an instruction, and Continue will generate an answer or edit for that specific prompt. While Continue doesn’t automatically commit changes or plan across files by itself, you could still use it to fix one issue at a time by manually prompting it for each issue. However, because it doesn’t integrate with Git out-of-the-box (it’s mostly an editor assistant), you would need to handle the capturing of its output and committing. In a programmatic scenario (like writing a module to iterate over issues), Continue’s CLI could potentially be scripted to apply a change and then your script commits the change. This is somewhat similar to using the OpenAI API directly (which we’ll discuss next) – Continue would just be a convenience layer if you prefer its interface. If you already use Continue in your editor and want the agent to work within that environment, you might consider writing a Continue recipe or script that processes a list of issues sequentially. That said, Continue’s strength is interactivity and quick answers, whereas your use-case is oriented around automation with minimal human intervention per issue. So it might not offer significant advantages over Aider for this particular automation task (aside from being another option if you run into limitations with Aider).
	•	Building a Custom Agent from Scratch: This is the DIY route – essentially creating your own mini-AI coder that implements the one-shot fix workflow. You would use an LLM (like OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude, etc.) via API calls. The high-level steps for each issue might look like: 1) Determine context (which files/functions does the issue involve?), 2) Prompt the LLM with a concise description of the issue and relevant code snippets, asking it to propose a fix (either as a patch/diff or just by giving the modified code), 3) Apply the changes to the codebase, 4) Commit the changes with a message. Rinse and repeat for the next issue.
Implementing this requires some effort, but it gives you full control. A few considerations if you go down this path:
	•	Prompt Engineering & Context: You’ll need to feed the model enough information to solve the issue, but not so much that it gets confused or runs out of context length. This might involve programmatically searching your code for keywords from the issue, or using static analysis to find where a bug might be. For example, if the issue is “App crashes when clicking the Save button”, your agent might search the code for a onSave handler or related components. You could incorporate a simple code search tool or use embeddings to locate relevant files. This is essentially what Aider’s repo map and file-picking logic does. Without it, a naive approach might dump entire files into the prompt, which can be inefficient. You could mimic Aider’s diff-based strategy by first asking the LLM to identify the likely snippet to change, then asking it to provide a diff.
	•	Applying Changes: Once the model gives you an output, your module needs to apply it. If you ask for a unified diff as output, you can programmatically apply that diff (for instance, using patch command or a library that applies diffs). If you ask the model to output the full modified function or file, your code would have to replace the old code with the new. Be cautious here – ensure you have a backup or are using version control, so you can verify the patch before committing. Given that you want the agent to automatically make edits, you might allow the script to directly apply the changes to the files, but perhaps gate the git commit behind a quick verification (even something as simple as running git diff to see that changes look sane).
	•	Commit Messages: You can either generate these yourself (e.g., use the issue title as the commit message) or even ask the LLM to suggest a commit message after it provides the code change. Commit messages should be clear and focused (e.g., “fix: handle null pointer in connect() to prevent crash”). Since each issue is separate, the “why” of the change is usually the issue description itself, which can be boiled down into the commit message.
	•	Error Handling: In an ideal scenario, each issue gets fixed in one shot. In reality, the model’s first attempt might not be entirely correct. If you’re automating this without any human in the loop, consider at least running the project’s tests after each change (if a test suite exists). If tests fail, your agent could either attempt a second iteration for that issue (possibly with information about the test failure) or mark the issue as needing human attention. This adds complexity (you’re now doing a mini agent loop per issue), but it can dramatically improve reliability. Even Aider, when used interactively, sometimes requires a couple of back-and-forth steps to get a fix right. In one-shot mode, any mistakes would end up in the commit – so decide how tolerant you are of that. A simpler fallback is to let the agent commit whatever it did, and later you manually review or test it. Since the changes are small, manually adjusting or reverting a bad commit is manageable.
	•	Development Time: Writing this from scratch might be a significant project. Keep in mind that tools like Aider encapsulate months of refinement (for example, handling tricky merges in diffs, or remembering to add new files to git, etc.). If you go custom, you’ll need to be prepared to handle such details. On the flip side, a custom solution can be lighter-weight – you include only what you need. For instance, if your issues are always about a specific subsystem, your custom agent can be coded with knowledge about that (where to look, how to test it, etc.), making it potentially more efficient than a general-purpose tool.
	•	Other Potential Tools: There are other AI coding assistants (both open-source and commercial) – e.g. Sourcegraph Cody, AWS CodeWhisperer, GitHub Copilot CLI (in beta), etc. Most of these, however, are not designed for unattended automation. They excel at assisting a developer in real-time, rather than taking in a task and spitting out a commit. One interesting avenue is using GitHub’s own forthcoming capabilities: as noted in the GH Action example, the author suspects GitHub may launch an “Issues to PR” AI feature ￼. Until that becomes reality, using Aider via GitHub Actions (or your own scripts) is a solid alternative.
There’s also research and emerging tools on AI-generated pull requests. For example, an open-source project “AutoPR” attempts to have LLMs generate PRs for given issues. Many of these are relatively early-stage. Since you already have experience with Aider and it’s reliable for you, leaning on it is wise. One more concept to mention: some have tried Auto-GPT or agent frameworks to fix code, but as you’ve seen, those tend to make grand plans and can wander off track. Your idea is explicitly not to have a single agent solve everything in one session, but rather to constrain it, which is a safer and more tractable approach. This plays to the strengths of current LLMs – they perform better on focused tasks with limited scope, versus trying to be an omniscient problem-solver over an entire project in one go ￼.

Integration and Workflow Design

<<<<<<< HEAD
    ```bash
    gitscaffold process-issues tasks.txt
    ```
=======
You asked about integration, particularly with a tool like Aider, and how to actually implement this in practice. Let’s outline a possible workflow using Aider (since that seems the most straightforward given its feature set):
	1.	Prepare Your Environment: Ensure your codebase is in a Git repository (it sounds like it is, since you mentioned commit logs). Install Aider (it’s a Python package, pip install aider-install as per docs). Make sure you have API access to a good LLM (Aider can use GPT-4 or other models via OpenAI, and also Anthropic Claude or local models). Also, configure any API keys or model preferences in Aider’s config. If your project is large, the repo map feature will scan it – that’s typically fine and helps the AI, but be aware on first run it might take a bit to index the project.
	2.	Issue List: Have a list of the issues you want to tackle. This could be a simple text file with bullet points or a more structured format (JSON/YAML with details). For each issue, you ideally have a short description. For example:
	•	Issue 1: “Fix crash when saving a file with no name (null filename handling in Save routine).”
	•	Issue 2: “Implement retry logic in the network client for transient errors.”
	•	Issue 3: “Refactor function X to reduce its complexity (no functional change, just cleanup).”
You might already have such a list from your planning or bug tracker. The key is each item is relatively independent and well-scoped.
	3.	Sequential Processing: Write a script or even use a simple loop in your shell to iterate over the issues. For each issue:
	•	Optional – create a branch: If you want each fix on a separate branch (useful if you plan to PR them separately or if you want to test them in isolation), you can create a git branch named after the issue (e.g., issue-1-fix-null-filename). This is what the GH Action did: it committed on a new branch and then opened a PR ￼. If you’re just working locally, you might skip branching and commit on your main or a dev branch sequentially. Branches add safety (you won’t break main if something goes wrong), and you can always merge later.
	•	Run Aider with one task: There are a few ways to do this. The simplest conceptual way: open Aider and literally feed it the instruction for the issue. But to automate it, you can invoke Aider via command line. For example, Aider’s documentation mentions you can run it with file paths and a prompt. You might do something like:
>>>>>>> parent of 5185e93 (fix: Correct infinite test loop and update Aider integration)

echo "Fix issue: $ISSUE_DESCRIPTION" | aider --no-browser .

(Where ISSUE_DESCRIPTION is the text of the current issue, and --no-browser . means run in terminal on the current repo.) The above is a bit pseudo-code; you may need to use Aider’s actual CLI flags. Another approach: use the Python API. Aider is open-source, so you could import its main module and call the functions directly with your prompt. But a quick and dirty method is just spawning a subprocess. The GH Action’s source code ￼ suggests it runs Aider in a Docker container with a single prompt then exits. Your script can do similarly without Docker if running locally.
	•	You might also specify which files to focus on. If the issue mentions a specific file or component, you can hint that to Aider by including the file name in the prompt or using Aider’s --modify flag (if it has one) to pre-select files. Otherwise, Aider will rely on repo map and its reasoning to open relevant files. For very clear-cut issues (like “bug in X file line Y”), specifying the file can save tokens and time.
	•	Ensure that auto-commit is enabled (Aider by default auto-commits each change unless you disable it). With auto-commit on, once the AI makes the edit, Aider will create a git commit with a message summarizing the changes ￼. You’ll see this in your git log. If you prefer to review before committing, you could run Aider with --no-auto-commit (as mentioned by users discussing Aider’s behavior ￼) and then script a commit after you verify the diff. However, since the goal is automation and the changes are small, auto-committing is convenient. You can always undo if needed (Aider’s /undo or just git revert the commit) ￼.
	•	Let the agent finish its work and exit. In one-shot mode, it should conclude after making the change. (If it ends up in a loop or waiting for further input, you may need to explicitly terminate or design the prompt to indicate that it should finalize the fix and stop.)

	•	Log Results: After Aider exits for that issue, you can capture any output logs if desired, but the main record is the git commit. It’s helpful to print to console something like “Issue 1 resolved, committed as abc1234” where abc1234 is the commit hash. This gives you a checkpoint. If you’re branching per issue, you might also push the branch or at least note it.
	•	Optional – Test: If you have an automated test suite, it’s wise to run it here (or at least run the specific tests related to that issue, if known). This can be part of the script. If tests fail, you have a couple of choices: mark this issue as failed (and perhaps append some note for manual review), or attempt another Aider run giving it feedback (e.g., “The fix for issue 1 didn’t pass tests, here is the error…”). The latter turns your one-shot into a two-shot, but still for that single issue. Depending on how robust you want the automation, you might incorporate a retry. If doing so, be careful to avoid infinite loops – maybe allow one retry and if it still fails, then leave it for human intervention.
	•	Proceed to Next Issue: Checkout back to the main branch (or create a new branch for the next issue) and repeat the process with the next issue prompt.

	4.	Review and Integration: After all issues have been processed, you will have a series of commits (each on separate branches or a combined branch). Even if all tests passed, it’s good to do a quick review of each commit. Since they’re small, this is fast. You might discover that the AI’s interpretation of an issue isn’t what you intended – if so, you can adjust manually or rerun that one issue with a refined prompt. Assuming things look good, you can merge these commits/branches into your main line. Because they were isolated, merge conflicts should be minimal (unless two issues unknowingly touched the same code – which you would catch in review or testing). This process is similar to how you’d handle multiple small PRs in a repository.
	5.	Documentation: Your commit history doubles as documentation. If you want an extra level of detail, you could generate a summary report. For example, your script could output a Markdown file listing each issue, the commit that fixed it, and the commit message. But this might be overkill. A nice commit message (possibly following the Conventional Commits style ￼ for clarity) is usually sufficient. Something like fix: handle null filename in Save button (issue #123) clearly ties the commit to the issue.

In terms of integration with existing tools, since you specifically asked about Aider and ease of integration:
	•	One easy way to integrate is via the command-line as described. If you find that clunky, you could modify Aider’s source to add a new mode (say, a flag --once "prompt" that runs the prompt and exits). Given Aider’s popularity, there might even be a feature request or extension for this kind of batch mode. Checking Aider’s GitHub issues (for example, people discuss configuring commit behavior ￼) could give insight if others have attempted it. The community might have suggestions on scripting Aider sessions.
	•	Another angle: If you’re comfortable in Python, you could use the OpenAI API through Aider’s library. Aider’s code likely has a function that takes a user prompt and returns a diff or applies it. You might call those directly. This avoids dealing with expect-scripts or parsing CLI output.
	•	Yet another approach is to use the GitHub Actions method even locally: i.e., use a container. But that’s probably unnecessary overhead unless you want to mimic the exact behavior. Still, it’s a testament that the approach works: create issue → run agent → produce commit/PR.

Does the Idea Make Sense? – Absolutely.

Your intuition here is aligned with both software best practices and emerging wisdom in AI-assisted development. Breaking down the work into small, independent tasks is almost always beneficial. We have multiple points of evidence that this idea is sound:
	•	Parallels to Atomic Commits: As referenced earlier, small commits that “encapsulate one logical unit of change” are easier to manage ￼. When working with AI, one author explicitly notes that by “committing incrementally, we minimize context drift, reduce hallucinations, and keep interactions reliable”. All the benefits of atomic commits for human developers – clarity, ease of review, isolating bugs – “apply even more when collaborating with AI” ￼. In other words, your plan to have the AI tackle one issue at a time and then stop is a way of keeping the AI on a short leash, which prevents it from going on tangents. This makes the overall development process more predictable and safer.
	•	Real-world Validation: The GitHub Action “issue to PR” example we discussed demonstrates this approach in action. Developers have successfully set up workflows where each issue (small task) gets its own AI-driven fix and commit ￼. They wouldn’t do that if the idea was unsound – in fact, it’s a solution to exactly the problem you described (being overwhelmed by a flurry of changes). By reviewing each AI-generated PR, they keep quality high. You can adopt the same pattern in your local environment.
	•	Avoiding the Pitfalls of Agent Swarms: You were rightly worried about conflicting edits and complexity from simultaneous or rapid-fire agents. Others echo that sentiment. In a discussion about coding agents, one developer remarked that letting multiple agents run free “seems insane” because “the agent goes off the rails on a regular basis”, often trying to fix things that aren’t broken ￼. Your one-shot approach inherently avoids this, because only one agent is ever doing something at a time, and it’s only doing what you told it to. It won’t start inventing new issues to solve while you’re not looking. If it does stray, it’s easy to catch on a per-issue basis.
	•	Maintaining Human Control: The iterative one-shot design keeps you in the loop. You’re effectively the conductor, cueing the agent when to start and stop for each piece of work. This human-in-the-loop design is increasingly recommended in AI tooling. Instead of fully autonomous agents that might make a mess, semi-autonomous tools that require a human checkpoint at each step strike a good balance ￼. You gain a lot of speed (the AI writes code faster than a human would) but you still guide the ship, ensuring it’s the right code being written.
	•	Tool Support: The fact that Aider (and similar tools) already have features conducive to this workflow (auto-commit, branch isolation, test integration) means the ecosystem is moving in this direction. You’re not fighting against the current – you’re going with it, but adding your own structure (the task list and sequential execution).
	•	Addressing Larger Changes: You mentioned concern that a “huge refactor” would be a list of many changes that might not work on the first try. That’s true – large refactors are inherently harder, and an AI might not nail it in one go. However, your framework can handle that by breaking a refactor into sub-tasks. If you ever did have a cross-cutting refactor that’s too big for one issue, you could still feed smaller chunks to the agent one at a time. In the worst case that an issue (or sub-issue) isn’t fixed in one shot, you simply run another iteration for that issue. This is still localized; it won’t spill over into unrelated areas. Essentially, the idea scales: small bug fixes take one shot; big tasks become a series of discrete one-shots. This modularity is exactly how complex software is best tackled, whether by humans or AI.

In conclusion, the idea of a one-shot, sequential coding agent is not only sensible, it’s probably the optimal way to incorporate AI into your workflow for maintainable results. By using a tool like Aider (or a custom-built equivalent) to automatically make and log changes issue-by-issue, you achieve a slower, more deliberate pace of iteration that you can follow and trust. Each change is documented in a commit, each issue remains distinct, and you retain the ability to intervene at any point. This parsimony in applying changes will pay off in reduced confusion and easier debugging. Many developers are gravitating toward this kind of pattern – treating the AI as a fast but focused assistant, rather than an autonomous swarm – because it yields tangible productivity without surrendering codebase stability ￼. Your plan makes perfect sense, and with the outlined approaches, you should be able to implement it in either an existing agent like Aider or a bespoke solution. Good luck, and enjoy the more controlled, sane development experience that comes with reining in the AI to do one thing at a time!

    Your idea makes **perfect sense** and addresses a real problem many developers face with coding agents. You've identified the core issue: **complexity explosion** when multiple agents or rapid iterations lead to conflicting changes, accumulated technical debt, and loss of navigational control.

## The Perfect Solution: Aider + Custom Orchestration

**Good news: Aider already supports exactly what you need** for atomic, one-shot execution. Here's how you can implement your vision:

### Aider's One-Shot Capability

Aider has built-in support for single-command execution via the `--message` flag. This allows you to:[1]

```bash
aider --message "fix the authentication bug in login.py" login.py --yes --no-stream
```

The `--yes` flag automatically accepts all changes, and `--no-stream` provides clean output for parsing results.[1]

### Your Orchestration Module Design

Here's a practical implementation approach:

**Option 1: Shell Script Orchestrator** (Simplest)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# issue-processor.sh

ISSUES_FILE="issues.txt"
RESULTS_DIR="results"

while IFS= read -r issue; do
    timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
    result_file="$RESULTS_DIR/issue_${timestamp}.log"
    
    echo "Processing: $issue" | tee "$result_file"
    
    # Run Aider with the issue as a single atomic task
    aider --message "$issue" \
          --yes \
          --no-stream \
          --auto-commits \
          >> "$result_file" 2>&1
    
    # Capture exit status
    exit_status=$?
    echo "Exit status: $exit_status" >> "$result_file"
    
    if [ $exit_status -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ SUCCESS: $issue"
    else
        echo "❌ FAILED: $issue"
    fi
    
    # Brief pause between issues
    sleep 2
done < "$ISSUES_FILE"
```

**Option 2: Python Orchestrator** (More Control)
```python
# issue_processor.py
import subprocess
import json
import datetime
from pathlib import Path

class AtomicIssueProcessor:
    def __init__(self, results_dir="results"):
        self.results_dir = Path(results_dir)
        self.results_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    
    def process_issue(self, issue, files=None):
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        result_file = self.results_dir / f"issue_{timestamp}.json"
        
        cmd = [
            "aider",
            "--message", issue,
            "--yes",
            "--no-stream",
            "--auto-commits"
        ]
        
        if files:
            cmd.extend(files)
        
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                cmd, 
                capture_output=True, 
                text=True, 
                timeout=300  # 5 minute timeout
            )
            
            success = result.returncode == 0
            
            # Save detailed results
            result_data = {
                "issue": issue,
                "files": files or [],
                "timestamp": timestamp,
                "success": success,
                "stdout": result.stdout,
                "stderr": result.stderr,
                "exit_code": result.returncode
            }
            
            with open(result_file, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(result_data, f, indent=2)
            
            return success, result_file
            
        except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
            print(f"❌ TIMEOUT: {issue}")
            return False, None
    
    def process_issues_from_file(self, issues_file):
        with open(issues_file, 'r') as f:
            issues = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]
        
        results = []
        for issue in issues:
            print(f"Processing: {issue}")
            success, result_file = self.process_issue(issue)
            results.append((issue, success, result_file))
            
            if success:
                print("✅ SUCCESS")
            else:
                print("❌ FAILED")
        
        return results

# Usage
processor = AtomicIssueProcessor()
results = processor.process_issues_from_file("issues.txt")
```

### Why This Approach Works

**Atomic Isolation**: Each issue runs in a fresh Aider session, preventing cross-contamination.[2]

**Clear Success/Failure**: Each task has explicit success criteria and detailed logging.

**Git Safety**: Aider's `--auto-commits` means each change is a discrete commit you can easily revert.[1]

**Parseable Results**: You get structured output to understand what worked and what didn't.

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Aider + Shell Script**: The simplest approach using Aider's existing `--message` flag.[1]

2. **Don't Build from Scratch**: Aider already handles the complex parts (code understanding, file editing, git integration).

3. **Use Aider's Python API** if you need more control:
```python
from aider.coders import Coder
from aider.models import Model

model = Model("gpt-4o")
coder = Coder.create(main_model=model, fnames=["file.py"])
coder.run("fix the bug in the authenticate function")
```

4. **Issue Format**: Structure your issues file clearly:
```
Fix the authentication timeout in login.py
Add input validation to user_registration.py  
Refactor the database connection pooling in db.py
Add error handling to payment_processor.py
```

### Additional Benefits

- **Incremental Progress**: You can stop/restart without losing work
- **Selective Execution**: Skip or retry specific issues
- **Clear Audit Trail**: Each change is documented and reversible
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple processors on different parts of your codebase

This approach gives you the **controlled, parsimonious workflow** you want while leveraging Aider's proven capabilities. You avoid the "swarm complexity" while maintaining the power of AI-assisted coding.
